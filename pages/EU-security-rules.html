            <div class="EU-Title">EU SECURITY RULES FOR LIQUIDS AT AIRPORTS</div>
        </div>
        <p>
            To protect you against the new threat of liquid explosives, the European Union (EU) has adopted security rules
            that restrict the amount of liquids that you can take through security checkpoints. They apply to all passengers
            departing from airports in the EU whatever their destination.
        </p>
        <p>
            This means that, at security checkpoints, you and your hand luggage must be checked for liquids in addition to
            other prohibited articles. However, the rules do not limit the liquids that you can buy at shops at EU airports located
            beyond the point where you show your boarding pass or on board an aircraft operated by an EU airline.
        </p>
        <p class="EU-attention">
            The rules apply at all airports in the EU and in Norway, Iceland and Switzerland.
        </p>
        <div class="EU-part-title">HOW TO COMPLY WITH THE RULES ?</div>
        <p class="EU-subtitle">While packing</p>
        <p>
            You are only allowed to take small quantities of liquids in your hand luggage. These liquids must be in individual
            containers with a maximum capacity of 100 millilitres each. You must pack these containers in one transparent,
            re-sealable plastic bag of not more than one litre capacity per passenger (see illustration below).

        <p>
            Should you depart from an airport in a country outside the EU and then transfer to a connecting flight in the
            EU, you must respect the above rules on the quantities and packing of liquids. And you are not allowed to take
            on connecting flights liquids bought at airport shops in countries outside the EU.
        </p>
        <div class="EU-part-title">WHAT IS STILL POSSIBLE</div>
        <span class="EU-italic">You can:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>pack liquids in bags that you check in � the new rules only affect hand luggage;</li>
            <li>carry in your hand luggage medicines and dietary requirements, including baby foods, for use during the trip. You may be asked for proof that they are needed;</li>
            <li>buy liquids such as drinks and perfumes either in an EU airport shop when located beyond the point where you show your boarding pass or on board an aircraft operated by an EU airline. If they are sold in a special sealed bag, do not open it before you are screened � otherwise the contents may be confiscated at the checkpoint. (If you transfer at an EU airport, do not open the bag before screening at your airport of transfer, or at the last one if you transfer more than once).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All these liquids are additional to the quantities in the re-sealable plastic bag mentioned above.</p>
        <p class="EU-attention">If you have any doubts, please ask your airline or travel agent in advance of travel.</p>
        <p class="EU-attention">Please be courteous and cooperate with airport security and airline staff.</p>
